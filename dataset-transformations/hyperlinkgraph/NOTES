The original hyperlink graph dataset is formatted as a series of text files
stored in the same folder. On each line of each file is a pair of tab-separated
integers that represent the source node and destination node for a link in the
graph.

The output placed in 1.normalized is of type RDD[Tuple2[Int, Int]], with a
pairing for each link.
