The original hyperlink graph dataset is formatted as a series of text files
stored in the same folder. On each line of each file is a pair of tab-separated
integers that represent the source node and destination node for a link in the
graph.

The normalize_node_ids.py script is intended to convert all node IDs in the
input files to be in a contiguous range of integer values.

The repartition_link_files.py script converts a dataset of N files to a dataset
of M files.
