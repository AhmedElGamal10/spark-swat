The original imagenet data is a directory of JPEG files.

The dataset we used is downloadable from:

http://image-net.org/image/ILSVRC2015/ILSVRC2015_DET_test.tar.gz

The convert_jpeg_to_txt.sh script uses the ConvertJPEGsToText to convert each
JPEG file containing N pixels to a text file containing a single space-separated
line where each element on the line is either the R, G, or B component of a
pixel in the original image. This output is placed in 1.txt.

The convert_txt_to_densevector.sh script uses the ImagenetConverter class to
convert each of those single-line text files to a Tuple2[Int, DenseVector] where
the integer is a unique ID for the dense vector parsed from the text file. This
output is placed in 2.converted.
